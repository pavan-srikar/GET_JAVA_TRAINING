# DDL Commands - CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME

/*Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. 
It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database.
DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data. */

# ALTER Table
-- The MySQL ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, modify, or drop/delete columns 
-- in a table. The MySQL ALTER TABLE statement is also used to rename a table.

/* Syntax:  Add column in table
 ALTER TABLE table_name
  ADD new_column_name column_definition
    [ FIRST | AFTER column_name ];  */
    
-- Add new column city  




-- Modify column in a table

	

-- Rename column in a table
	

# drop a column in table



# rename table



-- Create a new Table copy from existing Table


-- Delete table



/* MySql Constraints:

The constraint in MySQL is used to specify the rule that allows or restricts what values/data will be stored in the table. 
They provide a suitable method to ensure data accuracy and integrity inside the table. 
It also helps to limit the type of data that will be inserted inside the table.
*/
# DEFAULT constraint - Specifies a default value when specified none for this column

/*
#Check constraint - It is an integrity constraint that controls the value in a particular column. 
It ensures the inserted or updated value in a column must be matched with the given condition.
*/

/*
#AUTO_INCREMENT Constraint
This constraint automatically generates a unique number whenever we insert a new record into the table. 
Generally, we use this constraint for the primary key field in a table.
*/

-- insert data into default columns



-- set the new seed value for AUTO_INCREMENT



-- # Check Constraint
-- CHECK constraint to ensure that values stored in a column or group of 
-- columns satisfy a Boolean expression.



-- Unique Constraint
/* A UNIQUE constraint is an integrity constraint that ensures values in a column 
or group of columns to be unique.  
A UNIQUE constraint can be either a column constraint or a table constraint. */

--- Creating Foreign Key Relationship

/* The foreign key is used to link one or more than one table 
together. It is also known as the referencing key. 
A foreign key matches the primary key field of another table. 
It means a foreign key field in one table refers to the primary key 
field of the other table. */

Syntax: [CONSTRAINT constraint_name]  
    FOREIGN KEY [foreign_key_name] (col_name, ...)  
    REFERENCES parent_tbl_name (col_name,...)  
    ON DELETE referenceOption  
    ON UPDATE referenceOption  */
